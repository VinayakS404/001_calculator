### ✅ Why this README works well

- It gives a clear **project title and short description** (what the project is, what it does). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Lists the **features** so visitors quickly know what the calculator supports.  
- Describes **how to run/ use** the project (no dependencies — just open the HTML). That’s especially useful for a simple static-site project.  
- Mentions **project structure** so someone new to the repo can understand what each file is for.  
- Includes **license & contributing guideline placeholders**, which are good for open-source hygiene. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

If you like — I can **generate 2 variants** of README for your repo: one **basic** (just minimal) and one **detailed with screenshot, future-plan, and contributing guidelines** — you pick what you prefer. Do you want me to build those for you now?
